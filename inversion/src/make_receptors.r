# filter available footprints in footprints/ dir for the timespan defined in config.r
# author: Lewis Kunik

## prerequisite scripts:
##  none (but footprints must be present in footprints/ directory)
##
## output files:
##  receptors.rds - contains an (n x 2) matrix, col 1 has time of each receptor,
##  col 2 has filepath of each receptor
##  (receptors_aggr.rds) - if aggregate_obs is seet to TRUE in config.r, this
##  file will be created containing (n x 2) matrix, col 1 has the sitename, and
##  col 2 has the day (expressed in epoch seconds since 1970-01-01Z)
